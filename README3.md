We have created a bot to [echo message](https://github.com/wenewzhang/mixin_labs-php-bot/blob/master/README.md) and [echo Bitcoin](https://github.com/wenewzhang/mixin_labs-php-bot/blob/master/README2.md).

# What you will learn from this chapter
1. How to create Bitcoin wallet
2. How to read Bitcoin balance
3. How to send Bitcoin with zero transaction fee and confirmed in 1 second
4. How to send Bitcoin to other wallet

## Create a Bitcoin wallet by Mixin Network PHP SDK
Pre-request: You should have a Mixin Network account
##### Create Mixin network account
```php
$user_info = $mixinSdk->Network()->createUser("Tom cat");
```
The function in PHP SDK create a RSA keypair automatically, then call Mixin Network to create an account. Then the function return all account information.

```php
//Create User api include all account information
print_r($user_info);
print($user_info["pubKey"]);
$newConfig = array();
$newConfig["private_key"] = $user_info["priKey"];
$newConfig["pin_token"]   = $user_info["pin_token"];
$newConfig["session_id"]  = $user_info["session_id"];
$newConfig["client_id"]   = $user_info["user_id"];
```

Now you need to carefully keep the account information. You need these information to read asset balance and other content.

### Create Bitcoin wallet for the Mixin Network account
The Bitcoin  wallet is not generated automatically at same time when we create Mixin Network account. Read Bitcoin asset once to generate a Bitcoin wallet.
```php
$asset_infoNew = $mixinSdkNew->Wallet()->readAsset("c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa");
echo "BitCoin wallet address is :".$asset_infoNew["public_key"];
```
You can found information about Bitcoin asset in the account. Public key is the Bitcoin deposit address. Full response of read asset is
```php
Array
(
    [type] => asset
    [asset_id] => c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa
    [chain_id] => c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa
    [symbol] => BTC
    [name] => Bitcoin
    [icon_url] => https://images.mixin.one/HvYGJsV5TGeZ-X9Ek3FEQohQZ3fE9LBEBGcOcn4c4BNHovP4fW4YB97Dg5LcXoQ1hUjMEgjbl1DPlKg1TW7kK6XP=s128
    [balance] => 0
    [public_key] => 195p8R8Y15uzDGMrdVkELVUW2444psqiSq
    [account_name] =>
    [account_tag] =>
    [price_btc] => 1
    [price_usd] => 3928.11498197
    [change_btc] => 0
    [change_usd] => -0.006841408545228452
    [asset_key] => c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa
    [confirmations] => 12
    [capitalization] => 0
)
```
The API provide many information about Bitcoin asset.
* Deposit address:[public_key]
* Logo: [icon_url]
* Asset name:[name]
* Asset uuid in Mixin network: [asset_key]
* Price in USD from Coinmarketcap.com: [price_usd]
* Least confirmed block before deposit is accepted by Mixin network:[confirmations]


### Private key?
Where is Bitcoin private key? The private key is protected by multi signature inside Mixin Network so it is invisible for user. Bitcoin asset can only be withdraw to other address when user provide correct RSA private key signature, PIN code and Session key.

### Not only Bitcoin, but also Ethereum, EOS
The account not only contain a Bitcoin wallet, but also contains wallet for Ethereum, EOS, etc. Full blockchain support [list](https://mixin.one/network/chains). All ERC20 Token and EOS token are supported by the account.

Create other asset wallet is same as create Bitcoin wallet, just read the asset.
#### Mixin Network support cryptocurrencies (2019-02-19)

|crypto |uuid in Mixin Network

If you read EOS deposit address, the deposit address is composed of two parts: account_name and account tag. When you transfer EOS token to your account in Mixin network, you should fill both account name and memo. The memo content is value of 'account_tag'.
```php
'account_name' => $label,
'account_tag'  => $public_key,
```

### Deposit Bitcoin and read balance
Now you can deposit Bitcoin into the deposit address.

This is maybe too expensive for this tutorial. There is a free and lightening fast solution to deposit Bitcoin: add the address in your Mixin messenger account withdrawal address and withdraw small amount Bitcoin from your account to the address. It is free and confirmed instantly because they are both on Mixin Network.

Now you can read Bitcoin balance of the account.
```php
$btc = $mixinSdkNew->Wallet()->readAsset("c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa");
print_r($btc);
```
### Send Bitcoin inside Mixin Network to enjoy instant confirmation and ZERO transaction fee
Any transaction happen between Mixin network account is free and is confirmed in 1 second.

Pre-request: A PIN has been created for account

A PIN is required to send any asset in Mixin Network. Let's create pin for the account if it is missing.
```php
//Create a PIN.
$pinInfo = $mixinSdkNew->Pin()->updatePin('',PIN);
print_r($pinInfo);
```
#### Send Bitcoin to another Mixin Network account
We can send Bitcoin to our bot. You can find the uuid of app in dashboard or in config.php

```php
$trans_info = $mixinSdkNew->Wallet()->transfer(BTC_ASSET_ID,uuid_of_app],
                                         $mixinSdkNew->getConfig()['default']['pin'],AMOUNT);
print_r($trans_info);
```

Read bot's Bitcoin balance to confirm the transaction
```php
$btc = $mixinSdk->Wallet()->readAsset("c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa");
print_r($btc);
```
### Send Bitcoin to another Bitcoin exchange or wallet
If you want to send Bitcoin to another exchange or wallet which is not supported by Mixin network account, you need to know the destination deposit address, then add the address in withdraw address list of the Mixin network account.

Pre-request: Withdrawal address is added and know the Bitcoin withdrawal fee

#### Add deposit address
Call createAddress, the ID of address will be returned in result of API and is required soon.
```php
$btcInfo = $mixinSdk->Wallet()->createAddress("c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa",
                                                    "14T129GTbXXPGXXvZzVaNLRFPeHXD1C25C",
                                                    $mixinSdk->getConfig()['default']['pin'],
                                                    "BTC withdral",false);
```
The **14T129GTbXXPGXXvZzVaNLRFPeHXD1C25C** is a Bitcoin wallet address, Output like below, fee is 0.0025738 BTC, The API result contains the withdrawal address ID.                                                   
```php
Array
(
    [type] => address
    [address_id] => 345855b5-56a5-4f3b-ba9e-d99601ef86c1
    [asset_id] => c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa
    [public_key] => 14T129GTbXXPGXXvZzVaNLRFPeHXD1C25C
    [label] => BTC withdral
    [account_name] =>
    [account_tag] =>
    [fee] => 0.0025738
    [reserve] => 0
    [dust] => 0.0001
    [updated_at] => 2019-02-20T01:47:56.44067294Z
)
```


#### Read withdraw fee anytime
```php
$wdInfo = $mixinSdk->Wallet()->readAddress($btcInfo["address_id"]);
```

#### Send Bitcoin to destination address
Submit the withdrawal request to Mixin Network, the $btcInfo["address_id"] is the address id return by createAddress
```php
$wdInfo = $mixinSdk->Wallet()->withdrawal($btcInfo["address_id"],
                            "0.01",
                            $mixinSdk->getConfig()['default']['pin'],
                            "BTC withdral");
```
#### Confirm the transction in blockchain explore
